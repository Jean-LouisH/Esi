[Lilliputian](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lilliputian) is **a tiny 2D game engine framework** in which a complete engine codebase is provided for the user to create small 2D games by editting scene graphs and compiling link libraries from game scripts. 

It is named after the tiny inhabitants of the fictional Lilliput island that appears in Jonathan Swift's 1726 novel "Guilliver's Travels." This reflects the objective of keeping the engine as small as necessary.

It is being developed to replace the archived and unstable [Suprannua Engine](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SuprannuaEngine/blob/master/README.md) without being as large and aimless as the experimental [Lania](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lania/blob/master/README.md). This will be achieved by using existing code from my [SDL Sub-Engines](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SDLSubEngines), [Libretti](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/blob/master/README.md) and [Lania](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lania/blob/master/README.md) repositories. It started as a practical scenario to learn about and implement CMake through CMakeList.txt editting and to use testing frameworks like Google Test.
